# My Story

Hi! My name is Alex.

I moved from Kharkiv to Munich in 2013 to work as a web developer. I started taking dance lessons to enjoy dance parties and socialize. Later I discovered that active music listening and self-expression via dance makes me happy and socialization just became a great bonus. I love to culture travel and dance helps me to connect even better with locals, it's just like a universal language to communicate anywhere, for a long time I thought it was English ðŸ™ˆ

I started to work on WeDance to help people, who share the idea of dance as universal language and loves travel to learn different cultures and world history. WeDance for me is a worldwide community where you feel welcomed and collaborate with awesome people on interesting projects, while getting better in what you love.

My motivation as volunteer is to get better in executing projects, as well as improve my writing skills, storytelling, UI/UX design and marketing. I see myself as indie-hacker and those skills will help me to launch other great projects. I am glad to share what I already learned and looking forward to learn from you!
